            <h2>3. Securing a booking?</h2>
            <p>
              Bookings can be secured by contacting us by telphone or the website and paying the Â£75 deposit. The deposit is non refundable, but if you need to rearrange the reserved date we will endeavour to accomodate changes and offer alternative dates. The remainder of the balance needs to be paid no later than two weeks before your agreed party date.

            <h2>4. Space required?</h2>
            <p>
              Schools - a hall or similar large room is ideal, especially if tables and chairs are available. Parties - the space required is partly dictated by the size of the dinosaur you request. However, most of the dinosaurs are around 3m long. Some of our larger skeletons are nearly 6m long. None of the specimens are more than 1m wide.
